# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover any security vulnerabilities in our project, we appreciate your
responsible disclosure. To report a security issue, please avoid creating
public GitHub issues. Instead, email us directly at [others.premium.9@icloud.com](others.premium.9@icloud.com).
We kindly request that you refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly
until it has been addressed by our team.

We prioritize vulnerabilities present only in the latest version of our
product. This helps us focus on addressing the most relevant security concerns
and minimizing noise.

We take security seriously and are committed to promptly addressing and
resolving any reported vulnerabilities. Thank you for helping us maintain the
security and integrity of our project.
