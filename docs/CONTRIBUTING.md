## Opening a GitHub Issue

If you encounter a bug, have a feature request (please note that we want to
avoid [feature creep][feature-creep] and we cannot guarantee your request will
be accepted), or wish to suggest an improvement, please open a GitHub issue and
ask the [CODEOWNERS][codeowners] and community prior starting a contribution.

Provide a clear and concise description of the problem or suggestion, including
any relevant details or context. This will help us understand and address the
issue efficiently.

## Forking the Repository

To contribute to the project, fork the repository on GitHub and create a new
branch as described in the [GitHub Flow][github-flow]. This will create a copy
of the project in your GitHub account where you can make changes without
affecting the original repository.

## Updating Documentation

Documentation is crucial for understanding and using the project effectively.
If you make changes to the code, please ensure that any relevant documentation
is updated accordingly. This includes README files, code comments, and any
other documentation files.

Please follow [Readme Driven Development][rdd].

## Updating Tests

Maintaining a robust test suite is essential for ensuring the reliability and
stability of the project.

If you make changes to the code, please update any relevant tests to reflect
those changes. This helps prevent regressions and ensures that the project
continues to function as expected (see [TDD][tdd]).

The test folder (if provided) in repository will have documentation guideline
how to run the tests.

## Updating Code

Ensure to make your changes to the codebase and [commit][commit-and-review]
messages early and often, following the standards outlined in the project's
README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md file. Use [conventional commits][conventional-commits]
for commit messages, adhering to one of the following patterns:

- `<type>[optional scope]: <description> [optional body] [optional footer(s)]`
- `<type>[optional scope]: <subject>`

Refer to the table below for the possible commit types:

| Type | Description|
| ---- | ---- |
| build | Changes affecting the build system or dependencies |
| chore | Maintenance tasks such as upgrades or cleanup |
| ci | Changes to CI configuration files or scripts |
| docs | Documentation-only changes |
| feat | New features |
| fix | Bug fixes |
| perf | Performance improvements |
| refactor | Code changes that don't fix bugs or add features |
| revert | Reverting a previous commit |
| style | Changes to code style or formatting |
| test | Adding or correcting tests |

Exclamation mark (!) is optional and can be used to indicate breaking changes.
Use it before colon (:). i.e. `feat(auth)!: add login feature`.

For comprehensive documentation, [click here][conventional-commits].

If a backwards incompatible change is unavoidable, ensure to mention it in
your pull request and provide justification for the necessity of the change.

## Creating a Pull Request

Once you've made your changes and are ready to contribute them back to the
project, [create a pull request (PR)][pr]. Provide a clear and descriptive
title for your PR, along with a summary of the changes made, any related GitHub
issues and any notes on backwards incompatibility.

Be sure to follow the pull request template, if one is provided.

## Creating a new hook

To create a new hook, follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder in `hooks/[new-hook-name]/`.

1. Create a file inside folder `hooks/[new-hook-name]/` called `.lefthook.yaml`
within license header as the following code below:

    ```yaml
    # SPDX-FileCopyrightText: Copyright Yuniel Acosta, CU
    # SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    ---
    pre-commit:
      parallel: true
      commands:
        hadolint:
          glob: "Dockerfile*"
          run: |
            docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app -w /app \
              ghcr.io/hadolint/hadolint \
              hadolint {staged_files}
    ```

1. Create a file inside folder `hooks/[new-hook-name]/` called `README.md` with
the following content structure:

    ```markdown
    # [new-hook-name] hook

    ## How to Use It

    <!-- add content of how to use it -->

    ## Configuration

    <!-- add content how to configure the new hook -->

    ```

    > [!NOTE]  
    > For hooks that have scripts, consider [following the guidelines](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook/blob/master/docs/configuration.md#scripts)
    to place them in the correct `.lefthook/` directory.

1. Update the main project's `README.md` file to add this hook in
"How to Use It" and "Available Hooks" sections.

## License Information

To ensure proper attribution and compliance with licensing terms, we require
that all source code files include a [short-form SPDX ID][spdx-license-info]
license comment block. This block should be added at the top of each
source code file.

## Merging and Releasing

After your pull request has been reviewed and approved by the project
maintainers ([CODEOWNERS][codeowners]), it will be merged into the main branch.
Once merged, the changes will be included in the next release of the project
and the [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)][semver] principles will be applied.
You'll be asked for squash your commits if it's not following the standards of
the [conventional commits][conventional-commits].
